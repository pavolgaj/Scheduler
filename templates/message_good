Following objects in your program "{{ program }}" (program ID: {{progID}}) have requested number of observations with good SNR (value in log is more than 10 - SNR of reduced spectra is at least 40).

List of targets with number of observing and requested nights and mean SNR:
{% for obj in objects %}{{ obj['name'] }}: {{ obj['observed'] }} / {{ obj['nights'] }}; snr: {{ obj['snr'] }}
{% endfor %}

Please, use form "Modify object" on Scheduler web page (https://stel.asu.cas.cz/scheduler) to change their status or ask for more nights.
